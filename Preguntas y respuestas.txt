* The way Stormlight is used in combat is by using the power of the light to enhance the abilities of the one wielding it, for example, a warrior may use Stormlight to increase their strength, agility and endurance.
* Stormlight can also be used to create powerful magical effects, such as healing, shielding, or enhancing the power of other magical abilities.

* The use of Stormlight is often associated with the Honorblades, powerful weapons that are said to be imbued with the power of the Radiants and can be used to channel Stormlight.
